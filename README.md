## 🧬 Summary

### 🧾 Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous condition, making prognosis and treatment options challenging. Although over 200 genomic loci associated with susceptibility have been identified, the variability in circulating protein expression has not been extensively studied.

### 🎯 Objective
To characterize the proteomic profiles of IBD patients using Olink Proteomics® and integrate these data with genomic information.

### 🔬 Methods
In a case-control study, 73 plasma proteins related to inflammation were analyzed in 154 IBD patients and 369 healthy individuals. The combination of proteomics and genetic mapping enabled the identification of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs), offering insights into the interplay between genetics and protein expression in IBD.

### 📊 Results
- 21 proteins associated with chronic inflammation in IBD were identified, including **TGF-alpha, MMP-10, CXCL9**, and **IL-17A**, previously reported in the literature.
- In **Crohn's disease (CD)**: *FGF-19, FGF-23, IFN-gamma*, and *CCL11* showed high consistency across analyses.
- In **ulcerative colitis (UC)**: *MMP-10, CXCL11*, and *IL-17A* were the most relevant.
- Additionally, four **trans-pQTLs** (*RORA, STARD5, IGSF5,* and *RHOBTB3*) were identified, indirectly regulating the expression of key proteins.

### 🧩 Conclusion
These findings highlight the complexity of genetic regulation in IBD and the importance of integrating **proteogenomic** data. The discovery of trans-pQTLs opens new perspectives for **personalized therapeutic strategies** in inflammatory diseases.
