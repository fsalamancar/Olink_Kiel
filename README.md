## Summary

**Introduction:** Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous condition, making prognosis and treatment options challenging. Although over 200 genomic loci associated with susceptibility have been identified, the variability in circulating protein expression has not been extensively studied.

**Objective:** To characterize the proteomic profiles of IBD patients using Olink ProteomicsÂ® and integrate these data with genomic information.

**Methods:** In a case-control study, 73 plasma proteins related to inflammation will be analyzed in 154 IBD patients and 369 healthy individuals. The combination of proteomics and genetic mapping will allow the identification of pQTLs and provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and protein expression in IBD.

**Results:** 21 proteins associated with chronic inflammation in IBD were identified, including TGF-alpha, MMP-10, CXCL9, and IL-17A, replicated in previous studies. In Crohn's disease (CD), FGF-19, FGF-23, IFN-gamma, and CCL11 showed high consistency across analyses, while in ulcerative colitis (UC), MMP-10, CXCL11, and IL-17A were the most relevant. Additionally, four trans-pQTLs in *RORA, STARD5, IGSF5*, and *RHOBTB3* were identified, indirectly regulating the expression of key proteins.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the complexity of genetic regulation in IBD and emphasize the importance of integrating proteogenomic data. The identification of trans-pQTLs opens new opportunities for personalized therapeutic interventions.
